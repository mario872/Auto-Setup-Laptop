# Auto-Setup-Laptop
Pretty much just my script for a faster windows 11 Pro install, use if you want, created using MSMG Toolkit and chocolatey package installer.
Install and Setup.bat installs chocolatey and multiple apps that I like to use,  and also installs git and other command line tools I may add over time.
Rufus is a usb-flashing tool that is used to flash the .iso to the setup usb. This is how I set up my USB drive which is pretty normal:
