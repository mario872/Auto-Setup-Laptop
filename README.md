# Auto-Setup-Laptop
DISCLAIMER: This is an example for how I'm going to set up my new laptop soon, meant to inspire people to make their own auto setup, lots of the images etc are form other places.

This was created using MSMG Toolkit (Going to have to find out how to post the 4gb file) and chocolatey package installer.
Install and Setup.bat installs chocolatey and multiple apps that I like to use,  and also installs git and other command line tools I may add over time.
Rufus is a usb-flashing tool that is used to flash the .iso to the setup usb. This is how I set up my USB drive which is pretty normal:
